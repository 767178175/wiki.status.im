This code of conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will challenge prejudice that could jeopardise the participation of any person in the project.\n\n\nThe Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private whenever the project will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honoured by everyone who represents the project officially or informally, claims affiliation with the project, or participates directly.\n\n\nWe strive to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe considerate\n \n\nOur work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should consider them when making decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe respectful\n\nDisagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic fashion. We don't allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake responsibility for our words and our actions\n\nWe can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work to right the wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe collaborative\n\nWhat we produce is a complex whole made of many parts, it is the sum of many dreams. Collaboration between teams that each have their own goal and vision is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each part must make an effort to understand the whole.\n\n\nCollaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. Wherever possible, we work closely with upstream projects and others in the free software community to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue decisiveness, clarity and consensus\n\nDisagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them to persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction.\n\n\nWe expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements constructively. When they cannot, we escalate the matter to structures with designated leaders to arbitrate and provide clarity and direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk for help when unsure\n\nNobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep down considerately\n\nWhen somebody leaves or disengages from the project, we ask that they do so in a way that minimises disruption to the project. They should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership, authority and responsibility\n\n\nWe all lead by example, in debate and in action. We encourage new participants to feel empowered to lead, to take action, and to experiment when they feel innovation could improve the project. Leadership can be exercised by anyone simply by taking action, there is no need to wait for recognition when the opportunity to lead presents itself.\n\n\nDelegation from the top\n\n\nResponsibility for the project starts with the \"benevolent dictator\", who delegates specific responsibilities and the corresponding authority to a series of teams, councils and individuals, starting with the Community Council (\"CC\"). That Council or its delegated representative will arbitrate in any dispute.\n\n\nWe are a meritocracy; we delegate decision making, governance and leadership from senior bodies to the most able and engaged candidates.\n\n\nSupport for delegation is measured\n\n\nNominations to the boards and councils are at the discretion of the Community Council, however the Community Council will seek the input of the community before confirming appointments.\n\n\nLeadership is not an award, right, or title; it is a privilege, a responsibility and a mandate. A leader will only retain their authority as long as they retain the support of those who delegated that authority to them.\n\n\nWe value discussion, data and decisiveness\n\n\nWe gather opinions, data and commitments from concerned parties before taking a decision. We expect leaders to help teams come to a decision in a reasonable time, to seek guidance or be willing to take the decision themselves when consensus is lacking, and to take responsibility for implementation.\n\n\nThe poorest decision of all is no decision: clarity of direction has value in itself. Sometimes all the data are not available, or consensus is elusive. A decision must still be made. There is no guarantee of a perfect decision every time - we prefer to err, learn, and err less in future than to postpone action indefinitely.\n\n\nWe recognise that the project works better when we trust the teams closest to a problem to make the decision for the project. If we learn of a decision that we disagree with, we can engage the relevant team to find common ground, and failing that, we have a governance structure that can review the decision. Ultimately, if a decision has been taken by the people responsible for it, and is supported by the project governance, it will stand. None of us expects to agree with every decision, and we value highly the willingness to stand by the project and help it deliver even on the occasions when we ourselves may prefer a different route.\n\n\nOpen meritocracy\n\n\nWe invite anybody, from any company, to participate in any aspect of the project. Our community is open, and any responsibility can be carried by any contributor who demonstrates the required capacity and competence.\n\n\nTeamwork\n\n\nA leader's foremost goal is the success of the team.\n\n\n\"A virtuoso is judged by their actions; a leader is judged by the actions of their team.\" A leader knows when to act and when to step back. They know when to delegate work, and when to take it upon themselves.\n\n\nCredit\n\n\nA good leader does not seek the limelight, but celebrates team members for the work they do. Leaders may be more visible than members of the team, good ones use that visibility to highlight the great work of others.\n\n\nCourage and considerateness\n\n\nLeadership occasionally requires bold decisions that will not be widely understood, consensual or popular. We value the courage to take such decisions, because they enable the project as a whole to move forward faster than we could if we required complete consensus. Nevertheless, boldness demands considerateness; take bold decisions, but do so mindful of the challenges they present for others, and work to soften the impact of those decisions on them. Communicating changes and their reasoning clearly and early on is as important as the implementation of the change itself.\n\n\nConflicts of interest\n\n\nWe expect leaders to be aware when they are conflicted due to employment or other projects they are involved in, and abstain or delegate decisions that may be seen to be self-interested. We expect that everyone who participates in the project does so with the goal of making life better for its users.\n\n\nWhen in doubt, ask for a second opinion. Perceived conflicts of interest are important to address; as a leader, act to ensure that decisions are credible even if they must occasionally be unpopular, difficult or favourable to the interests of one group over another.\n\n\nThis Code is not exhaustive or complete. It is not a rulebook; it serves to distil our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.\n\n\nThe Status Code of Conduct is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license and has been appropriated from the Ubuntu Code of Conduct v2.0.

A suitable mechanism is one that \n(a)\n uses at run time\na copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\nsystem, and \n(b)\n will operate properly with a modified version\nof the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\nVersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne)\n Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\nbe required to provide such information under section 6 of the\nGNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\nnecessary to install and execute a modified version of the\nCombined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\nApplication with a modified version of the Linked Version.

Combined Libraries\n\n\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n\n\n\na)\n Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\non the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\nconveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n\nb)\n Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\nis a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\naccompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n\n\n\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License\n\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \u201cor any later version\u201d\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL EXCEPTION GRANTED BY COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\n\n\nAs a special exception, copyright holders give you permission to link this\nlibrary with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of\nthe license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute\nthe resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also\nmeet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of\nthe license of that module.
