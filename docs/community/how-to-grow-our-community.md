## Getting started

- at the moment much of the community communication takes place on slack.   A first step to getting involved can be as simple as joining [status-im.slack](status-im.slack.com) and saying “hi”.

- take a look through the #channels on the slack and join ones that interests you.

# Grow our Community

This is a list of practical tips and suggestions on how you can take part in, help to strengthen and grow our community. 
If you haven’t done so yet, please read our [Mission and Core Values](../getting-started/mission-and-core-values.md) and ensure you follow our [Code of Conduct](../getting-started/code-of-conduct.md), as these are closely aligned.

## Gratitude & Reciprocity

- Start by acknowledging each other, each new member and contributions. Whether that's welcoming people to the community or thanking them for their contributions.

- Think of ways you can encourage people to commit to contributing to the community on a long term basis. In doing so we can raise everyones willingness to keep this project alive. Whether that's taking an interest in someone, highlighting a task they might find interesting or even reminding them how we appreciate their accomplishments.

- Give constructive feedback on peoples performance, and if they like competition - encourage friendly competition with others.

- Find other ways to reward contributors, either through your own words, actions or material.

## Highlighting Needs

- Share your ideas on how we can make the list of tasks and needed contributions more easily visible. The more accessible and manageable tasks become to the community the better.

- Simple requests can be addressed by individual people, long complex tasks may require a handful of people to complete, so encourage and help create bands of people to accomplish those.

- If you know someone who would be great for a task, let them know! Don't pressure them if they are too busy.   

- If you are prominent in the community it is your duty to more frequently ask people if they are available for tasks.

- Offer people specific and highly challenging goals that suits them. Make them accountable in a friendly, non-pushy manner.

- Do your best to make tasks as clear as possible, work to create clear goals, give clear feedback, and challenges that exercise people’s skills to their limits.

- Any rewards should not be based on tasks but rather on consistent performance. Rewards should be impromptu.

## Community Structure

- How we can improve our tools for finding and tracking work that needs to be done?  The easier it is for everyone to see what needs to be done, the easier it is to contribute – If you have a suggestion then let everyone know your ideas!

- Explore the [Slack](http://slack.status.im) channels, where we have #dev-status, #dapp-chat, #lll etc.
    1. If you think there is a need for a channel (but your not sure) then drop in to #channel_manager and make a proposal.  If you are sure then go ahead and create the channel following these tips
    *  Make sure that the channel name is easy to understand
    *  The description should help others make a quick decision which channels they need to join.
    *  Invite other people on the slack to join the channel  (people may not notice it otherwise)
    2. When you get to know people in the community who have interests or skills then let them know about or invite them to join channels that play to their strengths.

- Always communicate the benefits of contribution, it will positively impact everyone in the community and increase the amount of people who will care and hopefully contribute.

## Culture

- Retain a similar culture to that of Ethereum, approach libertarian ideals with a level of pragmaticism, recognise there is a place in the world for private Blockchains but always keep the focus on the *Ethereum Public Blockchain*.

- Our community is a place to find friends, we're all human and we should treat each other as such.

- Make an effort to become familiar with anyone contributing in the project, get to know them over a period of time.

- If you've contributed, encourage other people to contribute too!

- Recognise development takes as long as it has to, even still, encourage clear goals to align with soft "deadlines" to help encourage contribution.

- Give more frequent feedback on tasks & contirbutions that have a goal.

- Never be silent about positive feedback, constructive feedback comes more naturally. IF things are going well, let people know! This will enhance peoples motivation.

- If a group gets too large, think of ways it can be split into smaller groups.

- Remember, we're all unique and good at different things in different ways.

- People will be more willing to contribute in an online community if they see that others are contributing.

## Appearance

- Try to maintain a professional appearance, whether that is profile pictures or site design, this makes us more attractive.

- Actively highlight and communicate your mistakes *and* accomplishments, be accepting of those who do. The faster mistakes are discovered the faster we can solve them, and the faster we can praise your accomplishments.

- Adding a task-contingent reward (for doing or finishing a task, regardless of performance) to an already interesting task causes people to be less interested in the task. The effect is larget for monetary rewards than for prizes, status rewards and charitable donations.

## Conversation

- Going off-topic is okay! If you have something you share that you think aligns with the general interests of the community, share it! Just make sure you do so in #status [Slack](http://slack.status.im) channel.

- If you like, show your face! Having a profile picture allows other people to recognise you, which comes in handy when developing friendships or finding each other in meatspace. 

- If you see any work that involves Status, whether it's a blog post, a contribution, someone talking about Status in another chat - let everyone know!

- We should show different metrics to different people on how we're growing, both in absolute numbers and as percentages!

- Look at ways other successful communities are working, see if we can find similarities or ways we can be better and talk about it.

- If you see any publicity and endorsements on Status, let people know!
