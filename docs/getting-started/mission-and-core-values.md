# Mission & Core Values

We believe blockchains, more specifically public blockchains, have the potential to restructure the very fabric of our society, and believe Ethereum provides a clear path forward towards an internet where users get to own their own data, and economies are built on open protocols. We imagine a future where decentralized applications make central intermediaries and centralised servers legacy systems.

## The Mission

Our mission is to facilitate the transition to a more open internet. Status strives to lower the barriers to entry to interact with Ethereum, and provide an onramp to Web 3.0 for the average smartphone user.  

## Core Values

- Our work is driven by a belief that Ethereum and public blockchains can yield great benefits to society, and access to DApps and Ethereum should be made available to anyone, anywhere.

- The systems we're creating must be open, permissionless, award fair access and democratise power.

- Communication should be clear and transparent to everyone in the community.
