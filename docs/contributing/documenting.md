# Documenting

Without clear documentation, new members to the community have no clear instruction on how they can help to make Status better. We truly value contributions that help to improve our documentation; whether that be tutorials for users, additions to the FAQs, or more granular instructions for developers - it all adds up and our community appreciates it :)

Our Wiki is powered by MKDocs, and is on: [https://github.com/status-im/wiki.status.im](https://github.com/status-im/wiki.status.im), and if you spot any errors, find parts of the documentation confusing, or have some suggestions on how we could have clearer communication we'd love your help, and feel free to let us know via the [Status Slack](http://slack.status.im).
