# Community Outreach & Marketing
Any communications efforts are welcomed, and it's necessary that any contributions that represent Status are closely aligned of our [Mission & Core Values](../getting-started/mission-and-core-values.md). Brand messaging needs to be consistent, honest, transparant and accurately reflect what the project aims to achieve.

Status is not yet ready for mass-adoption, and a clearly defined a user acquisition strategy will be outlined here at a later date. For the time being, contributors interested helping with community outreach should focus on helping to produce meaningful content and spreading the word amongst other blockchain enthusiasts.

## Get Involved

## Quality Assurance
A brand is a delicate thing, and any content contributions require acceptance from within our community before publication. Text content must be stylistically and structually well-produced with no grammatical errors. We'd be happy to help with editing and proof-reading :)
